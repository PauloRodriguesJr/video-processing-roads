#  Video Processing based Road/Lane Segmentation  

## Project Description

This repository is about my Final Project of my undergraduate course "Processamento Digital de Imagens" or Digital Image Processing, on UFABC, taught in the first semester of 2020. The project aims to try out different approaches for lane boundaries detection, road segmentation and also a vision based solution to steering angle feedback controller. The approaches were firstly sketched into one sample image of a road scene, and then tested on the full video.

## Techniques

For the project, it was applied the following techniques:

- Image thresholding + HoughLines for lane detection
- Color segmentation + Image Centroid for road segmentation
- K-Means for road segmentation 
- Deep Learning Model for road segmentation (trained on KITTI dataset)
