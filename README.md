# video-processing-roads
This repository is about my Final Project of my undergraduate discipline "Processamento Digital de Imagens" or Digital Image Processing, on UFABC. The project aims to try out varios approaches for getting the lane boundaries, road segmentation and also a vision based solution to feedback the steering angle of a vehicle using the acquired information. The approaches were firstly sketched into one sample image of a road scene, and then tested on the full video.
