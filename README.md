#  Video Processing based Road/Lane Segmentation  

## Project Description

This repository is about my Final Project of my undergraduate course "Processamento Digital de Imagens" or Digital Image Processing, on UFABC, taught in the first semester of 2020. The project aims to try out varios approaches for getting the lane boundaries, road segmentation and also a vision based solution to feedback the steering angle of a vehicle using the acquired information. The approaches were firstly sketched into one sample image of a road scene, and then tested on the full video.
